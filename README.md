# Barcino
A weddings and events layout planner created for University of Alberta Botanic Gardens, using the Godot 4.3 engine.

To install, start by downloading and installing the Godot 4.3 engine, then add these files as a project.
You can either run Barcino in-editor by pressing F6 in Godot, or create an installation.

To create an installation, start by installing rcedit. You will have to tell Godot where this is, in Editor>EditorSettings>Export>Windows>rcedit
Then, in Godot, go to Project>Export and select the preset you would like to use. If no presets are available, you will need ot download and install them, which Godot will ask you if you would like to do. Use the "Download and Install" option.
Finally, click Export Project, and save the resulting .exe to an appropraite location.
You can now run Barcino using the .exe.

Both rcedit and Godot are available in DBG Shared>Events>Events Software>PROJECT BARCINO>Required Software.
